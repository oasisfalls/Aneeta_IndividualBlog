## :crystal_ball: Week 2
Since there weren't any assignments due this week, I proposed a brief meeting to my team to go over and refine aspects of our game. My contribution to the meeting was more on the game aesthetic wise but also gave my opinions when suggestions were brought up about how we were going to tackle movement. 

In terms of research done this week for meaningful gameplay features, I became more inspired after our meeting because of when Louis mentioned we could use puns such as "brain fart" in our game. From here it made me think of how we could incorporate aspects of the brain into our levels.

The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain which includes 4 lobes, the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The frontal includes reasoning, planning, movement, emotions, and problem solving, while the parietal includes movement, orientation, recognition and perception. The temporal includes auditory perception, memory, and speech, while the occipital includes visual processing. Since our group agreed to do 3 "floors" of levels, I think that the lobes could represent each of the lobes, and although there are 4 rather than 3, the frontal and parietal could be combined as they do have a couple of overlapping features, and it could make for a larger "floor" to complete. I believe that this could really help represent why the smooth brain is fighting to hard to get to the top because the brain needs to absorb all the aspects of the lobe to become wrinkly again. 

Passing the puzzle rooms associated with a specific lobe would be based off of those features. For example a puzzle room on the temporal lobe could possibly have obstacles turn invisible after a certain period of time which would require the memory aspect to come in. Although this does not necessarily help with the movement issue that our team is still currently trying to figure out, I think that it would help aid how we want to approach movement with more premise behind the levels and puzzles.

I have not brought up these ideas yet to my team, but will be following up with them in our next meeting when we tackle the critiques from our game proposal as well as the game design document.<br>

## :crystal_ball: Week 1
This week I committed to the role as project manager and created the repository for my team where it includes links to their personal blogs and I will also be writing our weekly team blog posts. During our meeting I filled in the team contract and submitted that to canvas as well as e-mailing it to the prof and TA. I set up the Facebook group chat and helped out with the game proposal during our meeting. I created the slide deck for our presentation based off of the polished game proposal document and made sure that my group members were aware of which portion they would be presenting during class.<br>
