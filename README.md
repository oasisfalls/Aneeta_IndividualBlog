## :crystal_ball: Week 5
During all of our meetings I created docs to keep track of any notes that we would need to know for later and prepared the docs for the GDD as well as the playtesting template. For our second meeting I had created some notes about our prototype and also drew some level designs that we could work with. In our third meeting I updated the revisions for the GDD and completed two of the new questions that we had to incorporate and my team helped with the rest. Following that I formatted the playtesting document and the GDD and then combined them and submitted everything along with the zipped file of our game. My contribution this week was more towards orgaization and the two documents that needed to be handed in, but was also still participating in group discussions about what to add and opinions on our current prototype.

Following the submission I prepared the slides for our presentation this week!

## :crystal_ball: Week 4
With no assignments due this week I tried to organize an earlier meeting than usual but unfortunately it didn't align with all our team members so we went with our regularly schedule Monday evenings, and during the meeting I created the google doc to put all of our meeting notes in. I didn't really bring up any ideas during this meeting, I mainly brought up concerns that I had based off of our presentation during the lab such as if our game was even fun and if we really had a premise. I didn't have a lot to start working on this week so I started C# tutorials for Unity to be able assist my team more on the programming side.

## :crystal_ball: Week 3
This week I organized two meetings for my team. During our first meeting we worked on our GDD and I created the mockup of the home screen, options screen, and game over screen for the Functional Flowboard. I also filled out section 3 that defined the protagonist and antagonist. During our second meeting I had prepped our figma slides and assigned everyone a section based on what they worked on in the GDD. After that I submitted our final GDD, exported our slides, and prepared the template of the script so that I know when to switch slides when we are presenting in lab.

## :crystal_ball: Week 2
Since there weren't any assignments due this week, I proposed a brief meeting to my team to go over and refine aspects of our game. My contribution to the meeting was more on the game aesthetic wise but also gave my opinions when suggestions were brought up about how we were going to tackle movement. 

In terms of research done this week for meaningful gameplay features, I became more inspired after our meeting because of when Louis mentioned we could use puns such as "brain fart" in our game. From here it made me think of how we could incorporate aspects of the brain into our levels.

The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain which includes 4 lobes, the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The frontal includes reasoning, planning, movement, emotions, and problem solving, while the parietal includes movement, orientation, recognition and perception. The temporal includes auditory perception, memory, and speech, while the occipital includes visual processing. Since our group agreed to do 3 "floors" of levels, I think that the lobes could represent each of the levels, and although there are 4 lobes rather than 3, the frontal and parietal could be combined as they do have a couple of overlapping features, and it could make for a larger "floor" to complete. I believe that this could really help represent why the smooth brain is fighting to hard to get to the top because the brain needs to absorb all the aspects of the lobe to become wrinkly again. 

Passing the puzzle rooms associated with a specific lobe would be based off of those features. For example a puzzle room on the temporal lobe could possibly have obstacles turn invisible after a certain period of time which would require the memory aspect to come in. Although this does not necessarily help with the movement issue that our team is still currently trying to figure out, I think that it would help aid how we want to approach movement with more premise behind the levels and puzzles.

I have yet to bring up these themes to my team, but will be following up with them in our next meeting when we tackle the critiques from our game proposal as well as the game design document.<br>

## :crystal_ball: Week 1
This week I committed to the role as project manager and created the repository for my team where it includes links to their personal blogs and I will also be writing our weekly team blog posts. During our meeting I filled in the team contract and submitted that to canvas as well as e-mailing it to the prof and TA. I set up the Facebook group chat and helped out with the game proposal during our meeting. I created the slide deck for our presentation based off of the polished game proposal document and made sure that my group members were aware of which portion they would be presenting during class.<br>
