## :crystal_ball: Week 12

For the final week I did the gold code report, trailer, and assisted in making minor adjustment in each of the rooms to speed up the time for my teammates. Since we had 42 rooms it was very time consuming when we made one adjustment as there was no way of adjusting them all at once. I also retrieved the music from the students who created the original scores and sound effects and made sure to forward that to my team to implement properly.
Although I was more on the reports side of the process of this game, I was involved in a lot of the ideation and brainstorming every week and I think we managed to make something pretty cool!! Thanks for a great semester, it's been really tough but we made it!

## :crystal_ball: Week 11

This week was extremely busy, and my task was to work on the GDD and Playtesting report while also assissting in further iteration ideas and UI elements. I have also been in contact with a group of student composers these last couple of weeks to create a custom soundtrack for our game and have been providing them with feedback to assure that the music matches the aesthetic of our game. They will also be providing SFX. I've been creating meeting notes every time we have a meeting to make sure that everyone in the group has a guideline of what we are accomplishing this week, internal deadlines, and any other details about what we are implementing.

## :crystal_ball: Week 10

This week I just focused on our GDD and kept track of what we were going to do for our beta code in a doc, as well as noting which team member will be doing what.

## :crystal_ball: Week 9

No progress this week! But lots to come next week!

## :crystal_ball: Week 8

My biggest contribution this week was the supplementary items such as the GDD and the Playtesting Report. I updated our GDD, although given our poor time management, I did not get to add a new updated functional flowboard, and forgot to add pictures in the visual cues component of the GDD. Everything else was completed, I ran one of the playtesting sessions as well and formatted the document properly.I prepared the slides for our presentation and also created the temporary tutorial splash screen that we currently have. In the following weeks I intend to help more on the programming side.

## :crystal_ball: Week 7
This week I spent more time reaching out to friends who would be interested in playtesting so that when we are ready to playtest we have a wider variety of players. Otherwise, I just made notes of our meeting this week and did some C# tutorials for Unity.

## :crystal_ball: Week 6
During our meeting I created a doc to keep track of what we want to accomplish so that everyone is on the same page and we are all aware of the tasks needed to be done this week. After finishing up the meeting I just focused on preparing our new GDD by looking ahead at the upcoming deadline and incorporating the questions that are going to be asked, while also anotating the sections that we need to fix/improve on from the feedback recieved from our TA so that we do not forget for the next submission. I did the same as well for the playtesting document template that I created, and this time when we playtest I will be joining and observing alongside Radu. There wasn't too much to do on my end this week but will be doing more Unity tutorials to assure my team that I will be able to assist with that.

## :crystal_ball: Week 5
During all of our meetings I created docs to keep track of any notes that we would need to know for later and prepared the docs for the GDD as well as the playtesting template. For our second meeting I had created some notes about our prototype and also drew some level designs that we could work with. In our third meeting I updated the revisions for the GDD and completed two of the new questions that we had to incorporate and my team helped with the rest. Following that I formatted the playtesting document and the GDD and then combined them and submitted everything along with the zipped file of our game. My contribution this week was more towards orgaization and the two documents that needed to be handed in, but was also still participating in group discussions about what to add and opinions on our current prototype.

Following the submission I prepared the slides for our presentation this week!

## :crystal_ball: Week 4
With no assignments due this week I tried to organize an earlier meeting than usual but unfortunately it didn't align with all our team members so we went with our regularly schedule Monday evenings, and during the meeting I created the google doc to put all of our meeting notes in. I didn't really bring up any ideas during this meeting, I mainly brought up concerns that I had based off of our presentation during the lab such as if our game was even fun and if we really had a premise. I didn't have a lot to start working on this week so I started C# tutorials for Unity to be able assist my team more on the programming side.

## :crystal_ball: Week 3
This week I organized two meetings for my team. During our first meeting we worked on our GDD and I created the mockup of the home screen, options screen, and game over screen for the Functional Flowboard. I also filled out section 3 that defined the protagonist and antagonist. During our second meeting I had prepped our figma slides and assigned everyone a section based on what they worked on in the GDD. After that I submitted our final GDD, exported our slides, and prepared the template of the script so that I know when to switch slides when we are presenting in lab.

## :crystal_ball: Week 2
Since there weren't any assignments due this week, I proposed a brief meeting to my team to go over and refine aspects of our game. My contribution to the meeting was more on the game aesthetic wise but also gave my opinions when suggestions were brought up about how we were going to tackle movement. 

In terms of research done this week for meaningful gameplay features, I became more inspired after our meeting because of when Louis mentioned we could use puns such as "brain fart" in our game. From here it made me think of how we could incorporate aspects of the brain into our levels.

The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain which includes 4 lobes, the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The frontal includes reasoning, planning, movement, emotions, and problem solving, while the parietal includes movement, orientation, recognition and perception. The temporal includes auditory perception, memory, and speech, while the occipital includes visual processing. Since our group agreed to do 3 "floors" of levels, I think that the lobes could represent each of the levels, and although there are 4 lobes rather than 3, the frontal and parietal could be combined as they do have a couple of overlapping features, and it could make for a larger "floor" to complete. I believe that this could really help represent why the smooth brain is fighting to hard to get to the top because the brain needs to absorb all the aspects of the lobe to become wrinkly again. 

Passing the puzzle rooms associated with a specific lobe would be based off of those features. For example a puzzle room on the temporal lobe could possibly have obstacles turn invisible after a certain period of time which would require the memory aspect to come in. Although this does not necessarily help with the movement issue that our team is still currently trying to figure out, I think that it would help aid how we want to approach movement with more premise behind the levels and puzzles.

I have yet to bring up these themes to my team, but will be following up with them in our next meeting when we tackle the critiques from our game proposal as well as the game design document.<br>

## :crystal_ball: Week 1
This week I committed to the role as project manager and created the repository for my team where it includes links to their personal blogs and I will also be writing our weekly team blog posts. During our meeting I filled in the team contract and submitted that to canvas as well as e-mailing it to the prof and TA. I set up the Facebook group chat and helped out with the game proposal during our meeting. I created the slide deck for our presentation based off of the polished game proposal document and made sure that my group members were aware of which portion they would be presenting during class.<br>
