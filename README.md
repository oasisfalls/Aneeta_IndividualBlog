## Week 1
This week I committed to the role as project manager and created the repository for my team where I will also be writing our weekly team blog posts. I set up the Facebook group chat and helped out with the game proposal during our meeting. I created the slide deck for our presentation based off of the polished game proposal document and made sure that my group members were aware of which portion they would be presenting during class.<br>
