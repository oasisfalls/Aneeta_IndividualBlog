## Week 1
This week I committed to the role as project manager and created the repository for my team where it includes links to their personal blogs and I will also be writing our weekly team blog posts. During our meeting I filled in the team contract and submitted that to canvas as well as e-mailing it to the prof and TA. I set up the Facebook group chat and helped out with the game proposal during our meeting. I created the slide deck for our presentation based off of the polished game proposal document and made sure that my group members were aware of which portion they would be presenting during class.<br>
